// An abstract glowing "impossible star" shape made from interwoven strands of light and code fragments with themes from the biochemical and chemical sciences interweaved subtly (subtle organic molecules, different levels of hierarchical structure for proteins, etc--but subtly/cleverly), resembling a Mobius loop or Penrose star. The star is built from dynamic flowing text and symbols like "hydrate()", "::wavyText", "parseFrontmatter", and "motion()", with concentric rings rotating around it. Colors include neon magenta, electric cyan, and amber. Futuristic digital art, black background with cosmic particle dust, soft bloom and glow, high contrast, generative art style --v 6 --ar 1:1 --style raw --q 2
